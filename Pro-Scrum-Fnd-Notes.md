# Professional Scrum Foundations

## Team Startup (Me, Pierson, Alex)

Animal mascot: Red Panda

Value of working in teams:
	* Dynamic viewpoint
	* Chain of ideas
	* Efficiency

3 Things to learn in the class
	1. Learn project management
	2. Job experience
	3. Pass the test

scrum.org

Sprint Cycle:
	- Planning
	- Execution
	- Review
	- Retrospective

Take scrum open as practice for the test

Test is multiple choice 80 questions limited to 1 hour

## Scrum One

Come up with a basic web site.

Use Microsoft word for building a website

30 minutes to work

Website for animal:

Home page (image and navigation)
 - Image Gallery
 - Diet Info

What we'd do differently next time?
 - Do a little of the work

## Fundamentals to Scrum

Agile is a way of thinking

Demming approach:

  * Plan
  * Do
  * Inspect
  * Adapt

Scrum implements the empirical process

  * Transparency (We all know what is going on)
  * Adaptation (OK to change tactical direction)
  * Inspection (Check your work as you do it)

Scrum: A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Every sprint should be the same length and should not be more than 30 days. The average is 2 weeks.

Tasks: 

  1. Write the numbers 1 - 9 as many times as possible in 20 secs (avg 50)
  2. Write the letters a - z as many times as possible in 20 secs (avg 42)
  3. Write A1B2C3 as many times as possible in 20 secs (avg 25)

"In Agile, DON'T do low hanging fruit. Do the opposite."

"Defer constraining decisions"

## The Scrum Framework (1)

Roles
	Product Owner (only one of these; interfaces with owner; makes the final call)
	Development Team (3 to 9 people)
	Scrum Master (not a manager; a servant leader)
Events
	The Sprint
	Sprint Planning
	Daily Scrum (it is done daily)
	Sprint Review
	Sprint Retrospective
Artifacts
	Product Backlog
	Sprint Backlog
	Increment

Wants to see a product

## PSM Test

	* Empirical process

	* Go to community forum search for PSM

Estimating (story points)

	* Velocity (a variation of fibinacci sequence)
		- Tiny (1)
		- X-Small (2)
		- Small (3)
		- Medium (5)
		- Med-Large (8)
		- Large (13)
		- X-Large (21)
		- XX-Large (40)
		- Huge (100)


You can reestimate (affinity estimation) any time they change

Biggest - 13; Smallest - 2

	* Background 2
	* Image Gallery 13
	* Home 5
	* Diet Information 3
	* Animal Antaomy and Biology 5
	* Animal Behavior 3
	* Mating and Repo Info 3
	* Animal Habitat 3
	* Scientific Name and Class 3
	* Popular Culture References
	* Animal Communications
	* Misc Interesting Facts

	* Site nav - 3 (DONE)
	* Header - 3 (DONE)
	* Footer - 3 (PARTIAL - HOME missig)
	* Email - 13 ()
	* Search - 8
	* Contact - 3
	* About - 5
	* Cartoon animal
	* Logo

Group project: taking a set of pennies and have each person flip each penny then pass the pennies to the next person

Sprint Retrospective on sticky notes

	* Things done well (+)
	* Things to change (delta)
	* Action Items (star)

In Sprint planning, should dole out the tasks of a backlog item during sprint planning. Otherwise, my miss some tasks that need to be done.

If in sprint planning, the amount of work for an item is greater than initially planned, the product owner should be contacted and the item re-estimated or split into multiple items.

## Sprint Goal

This is a goal from all the items picked for the sprint. The goal can only be created AFTER the items are picked.

It is better to have the product owner review a finished requirement as soon as it is done rather than wait until sprint review in case something is wrong.

Output from the retrospective can be used directly in the next sprint.

## Definition of Done.

It is important to define done so that everyone knows when it is done.

Q. When to use Scrum? When not to use it?

A. Use it when the project is large and multiple people on the dev team that can contribute equally. Do not use it when the project is small or when there are a very few devs that can contribute.

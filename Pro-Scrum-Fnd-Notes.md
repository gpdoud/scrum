## Fundamentals to Scrum

Agile is a way of thinking

Demming approach:

  * Plan
  * Do
  * Inspect
  * Adapt

Scrum implements the empirical process

  * Transparency (We all know what is going on)
  * Adaptation (OK to change tactical direction)
  * Inspection (Check your work as you do it)

Scrum: A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Every sprint should be the same length and should not be more than 30 days. The average is 2 weeks.

Tasks: 

  1. Write the numbers 1 - 9 as many times as possible in 20 secs (avg 50)
  2. Write the letters a - z as many times as possible in 20 secs (avg 42)
  3. Write A1B2C3 as many times as possible in 20 secs (avg 25)

"In Agile, DON'T do low hanging fruit. Do the opposite."

"Defer constraining decisions"
